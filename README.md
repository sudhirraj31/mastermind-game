Try to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within ten turns.
After submitting a row, a small green peg is placed for each code peg
from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white peg
indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong
position. And red peg corresponds to both color and position is wrong.
